I made this repository to post codes that I've been making while studying (code lol).

# Main Targets

In the A&DS folder, I'm getting deeper in Algorithm and Data Structure (it was in my second semester of college) using C++. I feel that I need to train it a little bit more and it's important to have knowledge in one low-level programming language.

In the Front-end folder, I'm having my first contact with **JavaScript**, and training **HTML** and **CSS**.

This is also for me to train **Git/GitHub**.
